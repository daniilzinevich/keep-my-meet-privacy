Q: **Is this a contact manager or a CRM?**
A: No â€” itâ€™s a lightweight memory assistant inside Telegram, not a full CRM.

Q: **Do I need to install anything?**
A: No. The bot works inside Telegram. Just scan a QR and say hi.

Q: **Will the bot read my chats?**
A: Never. It only reacts to messages you send directly to the bot.

Q: **Can I use it at any event?**
A: Yes. You can create your own QR for any event, it will be linked to your profile and save attended events.

Q: **What about privacy?**
A: Everything is opt-in. Only public info is saved. Contacts are only visible to you.

Q: **Can I import past events or contacts?**
A: CSV import is under consideration for future versions.
