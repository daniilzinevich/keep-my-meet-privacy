# Privacy Policy – KeepMyMeet

> Last updated: June 2025

<ol>
<li>What KeepMyMeet collects</li>

When you interact with the KeepMyMeet bot, we collect and store the following data:
Your Telegram user ID
Your public Telegram information (e.g. @username, display name, bio)
The date, time, and context in which you activated the bot
Contact logs based on bot interactions (e.g. who scanned your QR code, who messaged the bot)
Any notes or labels you optionally add to contacts (e.g. company, role, follow-up tags)
We do not read your private chats or access message history.

<li>How your data is used</li>

Your data is stored locally within your own KeepMyMeet session and used to:
Help you keep track of new contacts met through Telegram
Generate recaps of recent event connections
Remind you to follow up with contacts you marked as important
Export your data to a format you control (CSV, Google Sheets, etc.)
Your data is never used for advertising, profiling, or shared with third parties.

<li>Optional AI Enrichment (disabled by default)</li>

If you choose to enrich a contact’s profile, KeepMyMeet may send the public Telegram username to an external enrichment service (e.g. GenSpark) to generate a short summary using publicly available data.
This is opt-in only, and results are not stored unless you choose to save them.

<li>Data control and deletion</li>

You may export or delete your stored data at any time by requesting it through the bot.
All contact data is stored per user; no other user can see your contacts or notes.

<li>Hosting and security</li>

All data is stored securely on encrypted servers. We do not store unnecessary metadata or track your location, messages, or device details.

<li>Questions</li>

For any concerns, contact the KeepMyMeet team via the bot or our Telegram channel.
